			<h2> Meditate </h2>
			
			<p>There are thousands of studies that have shown mindfulness meditation can positively impact mental and physical health. Whether it’s by reducing stress, improving sleep, increasing focus, or improving relationships, research shows mindfulness works.</p>

			<p>While the research on mindfulness, especially digital mindfulness programs, is still growing, there is evidence to support the use of mindfulness training for many outcomes.</p>

			<h2> Exercise </h2>
			
			<p>Exercising regularly can improve your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Exercise is crucial to supporting a fast metabolism and burning more calories per day. It also helps you maintain your muscle mass and weight loss. </p>

			<p>Physical activity helps you build muscles and strong bones. It may also help prevent osteoporosis. Engaging in regular physical activity can increase your energy levels. This is true even in people with persistent fatigue and those suffering from serious illnesses.</p>

			<h2> Yoga </h2>
			
			<p>Yoga develops inner awareness. It focuses your attention on your body's abilities at the present moment. It helps develop breath and strength of mind and body. It's not about physical appearance.oga studios typically don't have mirrors. This is so people can focus their awareness inward rather than how a pose — or the people around them — looks.</p>

			<p>Surveys have found that those who practiced yoga were more aware of their bodies than people who didn't practice yoga. They were also more satisfied with and less critical of their bodies. For these reasons, yoga has become an integral part in the treatment of eating disorders and programs that promote positive body image and self-esteem.</p>

			<h2> Health/Food </h2>
			
			<p>“Eat the rainbow” is a phrase that many nutritionists use to help remind people to incorporate more fruits and veggies in their diet. Naturally colorful foods like blueberries and red bell peppers contain antioxidants, vitamins, fiber, and many other nutrients that support healthy growth, and help prevent problems such as obesity, dental cavities, iron deficiency, and osteoporosis. </p>

			<p>For example, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables are abundant in vitamins C and A, which prevent cell damage, support healthy joints and eyesight, and lower cholesterol. Green fruits and veggies, such as spinach, asparagus, and avocado, are high in vitamins K, B, and E, which improve digestion and support healthy bones. Purple produce is high in vitamins C and K, which help with memory and support a healthy heart.</p>
